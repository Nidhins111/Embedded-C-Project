Image Steganography using LSB Encoding and Decoding

<h1>Secret Text File Encoding and Decoding in BMP Images</h1>
This repository contains a script for encoding a secret text file inside an image of BMP file format. The encoding process involves hiding the length of the secret text and then encoding the data into the least significant bits (LSB) of the image bytes. The decoding process extracts the length and decodes the text bit by bit to reveal the secret message.
